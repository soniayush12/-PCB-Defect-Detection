# PCB-Defect-Detection
PCB Defect Detection is a deep learning project that detects different types of defects in PCB (Printed Circuit Board) images using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It helps in identifying issues like short circuits, open circuits, pinholes, and more by analyzing PCB images.

# Here are the types of PCB defects this project can detect:

Open – a broken path where the circuit is incomplete.

Short – unwanted connection between two paths.

Mousebite – small rough holes or edge damage on the board.

Spur – tiny, unwanted copper traces sticking out.

Copper – extra or missing copper areas.

Pin-hole – small holes that should not be there.
